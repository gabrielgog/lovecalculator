LOL! Love calculator, this app reminds me of the days of Java phones, I wanted to do something similar for fun to apply to the Recurse centre. You can easily run the app when you extract the files and run it on your local machine or when you use this link to check. Othersiwe, feel free to make changes and deploy back to the original link. 

## To run locally. 
Create a folder in your local machine and run npm -y init the next thing is to run browser sync to watch the app for changes: 
npm install -g browser-sync

Finally whenever you want to start the app:
browser-sync start --server --files '.'
